## About me

I am a UI/UX designer with more than 3 years of experience in the UI/UX design field. Previously, I designed corporate web applications, design systems and there were many more design related tasks. For several months now, I was engaged in self-education, after that I discovered Rolling Scopes JS course and joined it. During my self-education period I have developed several single page applications, simple e-commerse store and social network using Redux framework. Currently I am focusing on completion of Rolling Scopes JS course and learn React.js in parallel. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/tomkoom) & feel free to contact me on any question.

## Code examples

**Bit Counting**

Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.

*Example*: The binary representation of `1234` is `10011010010`, so the function should return `5` in this case.

```
function countBits(n) {
  let arr = [];
  let remainder;
  let res;

  while (n !== 0) {
    remainder = n % 2;
    arr.push(remainder);
    n = Math.floor(n / 2);
    remainder = 0;
  }

  arr = arr.reverse();
  res = arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  return res;
};

console.log(countBits(1234));
```
